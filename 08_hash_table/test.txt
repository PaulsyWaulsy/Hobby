Equilibrium and Solutions

Solutions: how solvent interacts with a solute to form a homogeneous mixture of two or more
pure substances

Solute, Solvent: (Gas, Gas), (Liquid, Liquid), (solid , Solid), (Gas, Liquid), (Solid, Liquid)
Solutes are typically less abundant, and solvents are more.

Hess' Law: Irrespective of the path taken, if the start and end points are the same
then the total change in energy or enthaply with be the same. 
The total enthalpy change is equal to the sum of the enthalpies for all reactions.

Molecualr Intereactions and Gas Solubility
solubility of a gas is the cocentration of dissolved gas in a solution, in equilibrium with 
a specified pressue of the gas at a specified temperature

Interesting relationship, as the size of the a gas molecule increase, from He to Xe, the
amount of dispersion forces increases -> therefore has a higher solubility

Making a solutions in water is typically exothermic -> Energy is a product. As per Le Chatelier's
principle, as the temperature of the system increses the system with then favours the reverse reaction
to oppose that change. Here, the solubility decreases.

Pressure also impacts the solubility of Gas-Liquid solutions. If there is a closed system, increasing
the pressure increases the solubility of the the solutions, due to the pushing of gas molecules towards
the liquid.

Applications:
    when diving, you will experience more pressure forcing nitrogen into your bloodstream.
    If you were to emerge immediately, rapidly decreasing your pressure, then nitrogen gas will be
    released into the blood stream. Resulting in rupturing of blood vessels. If diving, you need to
    emerge very slowly.

    If you keep a drink cool, the gas will retain a higher solubility rather than in the sun.

Liquid-Liquid
The chemical structure needs to be considered to determine if the two molecules will mix in a solutino.
For Example, ethanol and water molecules can react with eachother very strongly, due to their similar 
Hydrogen bonding. Whereas, Benzene and Water, benzene is non-polar -> hydrophobic

Similar for Solid-Liquid Solutions.
